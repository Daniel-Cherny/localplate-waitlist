# üö® Viral Coefficient Analysis: LocalPlate Waitlist

## Current Situation
- **SF TAM**: 80,000 people
- **Target Signups**: 1,000 (1.25% penetration)
- **Required k-factor**: >1.0 for viral growth

## Current Setup Analysis

### Rewards Structure
1. **1 referral** ‚Üí Early Access Badge (Low value)
2. **3 referrals** ‚Üí One Month Free (Good value)
3. **5 referrals** ‚Üí Swag Pack (High cost, questionable value)

### Share Mechanism
- **Message**: "I just joined the LocalPlate waitlist! Get verified nutrition data from your favorite local restaurants."
- **Platforms**: 7 channels (good coverage)
- **UX**: One-click sharing, pre-filled referral codes ‚úÖ

## üî¥ Critical Issues for k > 1

### 1. **Weak First Reward**
- "Early Access Badge" has zero tangible value
- Most users won't even attempt 1 referral for a badge
- **Impact**: Kills initial momentum

### 2. **High Effort for Value**
- Need 3 referrals for anything valuable (1 month free)
- Average user shares with 5-10 people, 10-20% convert
- **Math**: 10 shares √ó 15% conversion = 1.5 referrals (doesn't reach tier 2!)

### 3. **Generic Message**
- "Get verified nutrition data" - not compelling
- No urgency, exclusivity, or local angle
- Missing SF-specific appeal

### 4. **Missing Viral Mechanics**
- No network effects (groups, teams)
- No time pressure
- No social proof in share message
- No referrer benefits visible to invitees

## üìä Viral Coefficient Math

**Current Likely Performance:**
```
Participation rate: 25% (250 of 1000 users)
Shares per participant: 8
Conversion rate: 10%
k = 0.25 √ó 8 √ó 0.10 = 0.2 ‚ùå
```

**What's Needed for k > 1:**
```
Required: 40% participation √ó 7 shares √ó 36% conversion
OR: 30% participation √ó 10 shares √ó 34% conversion
```
