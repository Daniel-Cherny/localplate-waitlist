# Form State Management Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the LocalPlate waitlist form to prevent data loss during validation failures and page refreshes by implementing comprehensive form state persistence.

## Issues Addressed
1. **Data loss during validation failures** - Previously, if validation failed, partially entered data could be lost
2. **No persistence during page refreshes** - Users would lose their progress if they accidentally refreshed
3. **Limited save triggers** - Data was only saved during step transitions, not as users typed

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Input Event Handling
- Added `blur` event listeners to all form inputs that trigger `saveStepData()` and `saveToSessionStorage()`
- Added `change` event listeners for checkboxes and select elements
- Data is now captured as soon as users leave a field

#### Modified Input Fields:
- First Name (`firstName`) - blur event
- Last Name (`lastName`) - blur event  
- Email (`email`) - blur event
- Phone (`phone`) - blur event (with existing input formatting)
- ZIP Code (`zipcode`) - blur event
- Dietary Preferences checkboxes - change events
- Referral Source dropdown - change event
- Restaurant Suggestion (`restaurant-suggestion`) - blur event

### 2. SessionStorage Persistence
Added comprehensive sessionStorage functionality:

#### New Functions:
- `saveToSessionStorage()` - Saves complete form state including current step
- `restoreFormData()` - Restores form data and step position on page load
- `restoreFormFields()` - Populates form fields with saved data
- `clearSessionStorage()` - Clears saved data after successful submission

#### Storage Features:
- Stores all form fields regardless of current step
- Preserves current step position
- Handles phone number formatting correctly
- Restores checkbox states for dietary preferences
- Automatic cleanup after successful form submission

### 3. Step Navigation Improvements
- Updated `nextStep()` and `previousStep()` functions to save to sessionStorage
- Current step position is preserved across page refreshes
- Form returns users to their last active step

### 4. Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around sessionStorage operations
- Graceful degradation if sessionStorage is unavailable
- Console warnings for debugging storage issues

## Technical Implementation

### SessionStorage Data Structure
```javascript
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe", 
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "5551234567",  // Stored as clean numbers
  "zipcode": "12345",
  "preferences": ["vegetarian", "gluten-free"],
  "referralSource": "friend",
  "restaurantSuggestion": "Local Bistro",
  "currentStep": 2
}
```

### Key Behavior Changes
- **Before**: Data saved only on step transitions
- **After**: Data saved on blur/change events + step transitions

- **Before**: Page refresh = lost progress  
- **After**: Page refresh = restored to exact previous state

- **Before**: Validation failure could lose partial data
- **After**: All entered data persists through validation failures

## Files Modified
- `waitlist.js` - Main implementation
- Added comprehensive sessionStorage management
- Enhanced event handling for all form inputs
- Improved step navigation with persistence

## Testing
Created `test-form-persistence.html` for testing the new functionality:
- SessionStorage inspector
- Form data simulation
- Manual testing interface

## Usage Impact
- **User Experience**: Significantly improved - no data loss scenarios
- **Performance**: Minimal impact - localStorage operations are fast
- **Browser Support**: Works in all modern browsers with sessionStorage support
- **Accessibility**: No changes to accessibility features

## Future Enhancements
- Could add visual indicators when data is being saved
- Could implement auto-save timers for additional protection
- Could add form validation state persistence
